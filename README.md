# musical-time-machine

I'm going to be building a Python time machine, which will go back in time to find the music that was in the top 100 shots that was being played all over the radio so 
that you can relive that period of time once more through music. Billboard compiles a list of the top 100 songs. There is a feature where you can change the date to any data in the past 20 years. 

First, I'm going to use Beautiful Soup to scrape the top 100 songs from a particular date of my choice. Then I'm going to extract all of the song titles from the list, and then I'm going to use the Spotify API to create a playlist for that particular date.
